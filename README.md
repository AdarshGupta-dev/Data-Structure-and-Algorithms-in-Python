# Data Structure & Algorithms in Python

I have decided to thoroughly study `Data Structure & Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Roberto Tamassia`.
Along the way, I would be making taking well detailed notes.

This repo would contain my notes, my approach to problems in the book and my solution to assignments.
