# Data Structure & Algorithms in Python

I have decided to thoroughly study `Data Structure & Algorithms in Python` in preparation of FAANG interview.
In next 4 months, I hope to finish these books.

1. **Data Structure & Algorithms in Python** *by* Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Roberto Tamassia
2. **Elements of Programming Interviews in Python The Insidersâ€™ Guide** *by* Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash
3. **Cracking the Coding Interview - 189 Programming Questions and Solutions** *by* Gayle Laakmann McDowell
4. Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition by T.H. Cormen, C.E. Leiserson, R.L. Rivest and C. Stein

Along the way, I would be making taking well detailed notes, while solving each of exercises and assignments.

This repo would contain my notes, my approach to problems in the book and my solution to assignments.
You can use this as reference for your dive in DSA and job prep.

Good luck to both of us.
