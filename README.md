# Data Structure & Algorithms in Python

Hi,

I have decided to thoroughly study `Data Structure & Algorithms in Python` in preparation for FAANG interview.
In the next 4 months, I hope to finish all of these books.

1. **Data Structure & Algorithms in Python** *by* Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Roberto Tamassia
2. **Elements of Programming Interviews in Python The Insidersâ€™ Guide** *by* Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash
3. **Cracking the Coding Interview - 189 Programming Questions and Solutions** *by* Gayle Laakmann McDowell
4. **Introduction to Algorithms**, Third Edition *by* T.H. Cormen, C.E. Leiserson, R.L. Rivest and C. Stein

I plan to solve each exercise and assignment in all of these books~.

This repo would contain my notes, my approach to problems in the book and my solution to assignments.
You can use this as a reference for your dive in DSA and job prep.

Good luck to both of us.
